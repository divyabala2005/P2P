Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System 

The Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System is a Python-based project that facilitates direct file transfers between devices without the need for a central server. It uses Python's socket library to establish TCP/IP connections, allowing a sender to transmit files to a receiver over a network. The project demonstrates core networking concepts like peer-to-peer communication and socket programming, making it an excellent educational tool.

The system consists of two main components:

Sender: Reads the file and transfers it in chunks to the receiver.

Receiver: Listens for connections, accepts the file, and saves it locally.

Key features include simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and ease of customization. The system is suitable for local networks, lightweight, and provides a hands-on understanding of network communication.

Future enhancements like file encryption, multi-file transfer, progress tracking, and GUI development can make the system more robust and user-friendly. This project serves as a foundation for real-world file-sharing applications while offering significant learning opportunities for students and developers.
